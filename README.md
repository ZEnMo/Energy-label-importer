# Energy label importer
This is an omporter to connect EP-online to a selection of households using BAG 'Verblijfsobject ID'.
It can freely used by anyone wanting to get their own selection of an EP-online database on energy labels.

The energy label files itself are too large to share but can be downloaded from https://www.ep-online.nl/PublicData
